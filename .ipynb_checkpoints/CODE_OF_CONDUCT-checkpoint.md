# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for
learning and contributing.  All members of the group and
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in this project
is required to conform to the Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct applies to
in-person and online meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Piazza and GitHub.

## The Group 2 Code of Conduct
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we
do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or
that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate
discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not
limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social
origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority,
property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and
experience level.
All members of the group are required to conform to this
Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces involved in this project including, but
not limited to, in-person and online meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Piazza and GitHub.

### Expected Behavior

All members are expected to show respect
and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of
platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and
professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviours in all meetings and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
comply immediately. This applies to all meetings and platforms, either
online or in-person. If a member engages in behavior that violates this
code of conduct, the member in question will be reported to the professor.
