# Summary

The largest problems animal shelters are facing in North America is a lack of space and people to care for the large
number of animals they receive everyday. Each day across the United States in 2023, 13,000 animals entered shelters with
many more still being on the streets as strays [@welfare]. Additionally many animals received by shelters have health
conditions that need immediate attention or could potentially spread to other animals, which require more resources to
ensure swift treatment of these animals and measures to prevent the spread of sickness within these facilities. It is
important that shelters are able to make quick decisions about where they dedicate their limited resources and optimize
the adoption process to ensure as many animals are able to find home as possible.

Our project uses animal shelter data from @data to predict whether or not an animal will be adopted based on their age,
sex, animal type, intake condition, intake type, and length of stay at shelter. Using predictive analysis in R, we create
a k-nearest neighbor model to predict if an animal is going to be adopted based on the features listed above. 
This analysis aims to help enhance adoption rates, so shelters can recognize which animals are unlikely to get adopted
and tailor their outreach and marketing strategies to specifically promote the adoption of those animals. Additionally,
better understanding which animals are at a higher risk of not being adopted allows shelters to allocate resources more
effectively, by providing additional care and resources to help those that are unlikely to be adopted.  

# Introduction

Animal shelters provide a valuable service for both homeless animals and prospective pet owners, but more and more they
are failing the animals due to being over capacity and having a lack of resources. The Shelter Animals Count Database
describes the root of the problem as "more animals are entering shelters than are leaving them" [@euthanasia]. Due to
this, many animals must be gotten rid of before they even have a chance to be adopted. According to @cause-for-paws over
4000 animals are euthanised in US shelters per day. This is an animal treatment crisis, as shelters struggle to find
animals new homes. While many people are interested in adopting from shelters, they aren't doing it at high enough rates
compared to animal abandonment. For the sake of the animals and shelters' continued success in their mission, It is
important to figure out how best to address this issue.

A report from @hills says that one of the biggest obstacles in the way of pet adoption is guardians' unrealistic
expectations. By examining the data on what prospective adopters look for in a pet, we can assess how shelters can
address these issues. While certain qualities might be more desirable, shelters can focus their efforts on aiding those
animals that might otherwise be overlooked. @tips suggests streamlining adoption processes, better matchmaking, and
enhanced marketing are all valuable ways to increase adoption in shelters. All of these can be aided by analysis of
adoption data. By figuring out what characteristics in animals are most relevant to adoption, shelters can focus their
marketing efforts and resources into helping the animals that need it most. In our project, we will attempt to predict
whether an animal will be adopted or not based on different descriptive factors of the animal, so that shelters are
better equipped to find homes for as many animals as possible.

Research Question: Can we predict whether an animal will be adopted based on certain factors?

We used data from the Long Beach Animal Shelter which contains:

# Methods and Results

To clean the data, we decided to only select the variables `animal_type`, `primary_color`, `sex`, `dob`,
`intake_condition`, `intake_type`, and `outcome_type` as we believe these variables would be the most relevant to helping
us predict whether an animal is likely to be adopted or not. We also made sure to omit all the NA values in order to no
skew the data analysis.

Additionally, because the `outcome_type` variable had so many different variations of results, we decided to group them
into only 2 outcomes (Adopted vs Not Adopted) as that is what we are most interested in. So, we decided to create another
variable called `outcome_group` to add our analysis of predicting adoptability.

For our summarization of data, we decided to look a detailed look at the outcome types, and we also decided to show how
many animals are
adopted vs not adopted to see if there are any biases, and if there is enough data for both outcomes. Additionally, we
decided to show a more detailed look of the different intake conditions.

## Exploratory Analysis Visualizations

![Animal Type vs Outcome Group (adopted / not adopted)](../results/type-v-group-plot.png){width=75% #fig-typegroup}

**Explanation of Relevance:** Based on @fig-typetype and @fig-typegroup, we can see a high adoptability rate if the
animal is livestock, a rabbit, a guinea pig, a reptile, or a cat. This is relevant to our question as it allows us to
see which animal types are the most likely to get adopted overall in comparison to some that may be returned to the wild
or euthanized. However, it's important to note that when we look at the Animal Type vs Outcome type visualization, a
large proportion of animals get returned to owners and to the wild. 

![Intake Condition vs Outcome Type](../results/cond-v-type-plot.png){width=75% #fig-condtype}

![Intake Condition vs Outcome Group (adopted / not adopted)](../results/cond-v-group-plot.png){width=75% #fig-condgroup}

**Explanation of Relevance:** Based on @fig-condtype and @fig-condgroup we can see there is a clear
relationship between animals that are severely ill and/or injured, feral, have welfare seizures, and have severe
behavioral problems when they arrive at the shelter and not having a high adoptability rate later on. This can also be
explained by looking at the Intake Condition vs Outcome Type visualization, as we can see that there are high rates of
ethunaisa for animals that have severe behavior or are severely injured at intake. These visualizations are relevant to
our question because it shows that animals that need more care are less likely to get adopted, this could be attributed 
to the animal sadly passing away while at the animal shelter or people being less likely to adopt animals that might need
more care (whether thats due to financial concerns or otherwise). This is important as it shows that animal shelter
could focus on helping these animals get adopted more often through appealing emotionally to the public or expanding
their reach to 'market' the shelter animals to a wider audience that may be more willing to take in animals that require
more care.  

![Age at Intake vs Outcome Group (adopted / not adopted)](../results/age-v-group-plot.png){width=75% #fig-age}

**Explanation of Relevance:** Based on @fig-age, we can see that the median age for animals that end up being adopted is
slightly lower than those that don't end up getting adopted. However, both groups have a large number of outliers for
much older animals. The adopted group has a lower median age and a wider range toward younger ages. This is relevant
because it shows that there is a clear preference for younger animals, and animals that are on the older side don't tend
to be adopted as frequently. This means there could be an improvement in how the animal shelter uses its resources in
promoting the adoption of older animals. 

## Feature Engineering 

Studies have shown that the longer animals have been in a shelter, the less likely they are to be adopted. In order
to utilize this knowledge as a feature we have created the `days_in_shelter` feature by finding the number of days they
were in the shelter from their intake day to their outcome day.

Additionally, many pets are more likely to be adopted when they are young, with older animals being less likely to get
adopted. If we were to just use their date of birth as the predictor it would not actually account for how old the animal
is was when the left the shelter. To better represent that age we created the `age_in_days feature`, which calculates
the number of days old the animal was one their outcome day using dob and outcome_date.

## Classification Analysis

We currently have one large data set that contains all of our animal shelter observations. In order to be able to gauge
the performance of our classification model we split it into two data set: training data and validation data.

We used the training data to build our model and tune our model and save our validation data
to test the final accuracy of the model on new, unseen data. This gives us an estimate of how the model would perform
when given unclassified, 'real-world' data.

Next, we have to build our classification model. We used K-Nearest Neighbors as our classification model as it
doesn't have an specific assumption about data distribution, it is robust to noise data, it is easy to implement and
tune, and it is an efficient model since it does not require a training phase.

To tune our model, we found the accuracy of the model using different numbers of neighbors (k) from 1 to 25. The
higher the k value, the more complex our model becomes, so it is important to ensure that the k is not too high and
causing the model to over fit to our training data, and not be general enough to accurately predict the training data.

Using @fig-elbow, we found that the best number of neighbors (k) for our classification is 5. This is the
point where any significant improvement in accuracy begins to plateau and choosing a k value that is larger could
potentially lead to over fitting the model. Using this k, we fitted our model on the training data and generated
predictions based on our test data. 

![Confusion Matrix for our model](../results/confusion_matrix.png){width=75% #fig-confmat}

```{r}
#| label: tbl-modelsum
#| tbl-cap: Summary statistics based on our models prediction
model_summary <- read_csv(../results/summary.csv)

kable(model_summary)
```

To visualize our results, we created a confusion matrix (@fig-confmat) to assess our model's performance and some summary
statistics (@tbl-modelsum) to assess our model's accuracy.

# Discussion

With a final accuracy of around 76%, we can fairly confidently state that we were able to successfully predict whether or
not an animal would be adopted, at least to an extent. Unfortunately, one of the shortcomings of our chosen analysis
model is the lack of feature importances. K nearest neighbours is a non-parametric model, meaning that it does not use
coefficients to make its predictions, and as such it is unclear which features in this model contributed the most to this
final result. However, what we have produced still serves as a valuable tool for shelter owners as a pre-trained model
designed to predict whether or not an animal will be adopted. Overall, we are glad to see that our model functions well
as it currently exists, but room for improvement still remains. An accuracy of 76% is good, but not fantastic, and we
would be able to gain even more information by utilizing a model that would allow us to determine which specific factors
contribute to an animal being adopted or not. These are important questions to consider in the future, and can be easily
developed with further analysis of this data.
