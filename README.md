## Contributors:

## Summary:
We used knn-classification in order to determine whether a pet would be adopted or not based on 6 predictors.

## Dependencies:
- readr
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidymodels
- caret
- gridExtra

## Licenses:
- MIT license

## How to run the analysis:
In your terminal, run the command

`docker pull ribbitsm/animal_shelter_image_group2`

This will get the container onto your local computer. Then run
`docker run --rm -it -p ribbitsm/animal_shelter_image_group2`

This will start the container. To Run the analysis go to a browser and go to localhost:8888/lab. From here you can open the notebook from the file directory on the side and run the analysis by selecting `run all cells` from the run menu at the top.
